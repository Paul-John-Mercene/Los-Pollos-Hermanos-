# Icon

<box header>
    An icon component in Vue is a reusable user interface element that represents a visual symbol or graphic that conveys meaning or represents an action, object, or concept. Icons are commonly used to enhance the user experience by providing visual cues and improving the usability and aesthetics of an application.

    The icon component in Vue typically consists of a container that holds a graphical representation of an icon.

## Default
    We have the `v-icon` component. The v-icon component provides a large set of glyphs to provide context to various aspects of your application. For a list of all available icons, visit the official Material Design Icons page. To use any of these icons simply use the mdi- prefix followed by the icon name.
