# Menu

<box header>
    A menu component in Vue is a reusable user interface element that displays a list of options or commands in a hierarchical or dropdown format. It is commonly used to create navigation menus, context menus, or dropdown menus within an application.

The menu component typically consists of a container that holds a collection of menu items. Each menu item represents an option or command that users can select or interact with.

<box>

## Default

We have the `v-menu` component.

## Props
A wide array of props can be employed to modify the v-menu componentâ€™s look and functionality.

### Location
Menu can be offset relative to the activator by using the location prop

### Open on hover
Menus can be accessed using hover instead of clicking with the open-on-hover prop.

### Use In components
Menus can be placed within almost any component.
